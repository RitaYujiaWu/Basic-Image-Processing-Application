# Basic-Image-Processing-Application
(this is a project for DSC20 in UCSD)  
  
In this project, we developed a basic image processing app with five distinct parts including image storage, various image processing methods, stimulation of a monetized app with inheritance, and implementation of a KNN classifier to predict image labels.  

## A glance at the function we achieved:
